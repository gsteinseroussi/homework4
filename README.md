I created a short timed quiz that gives you one point for every correct answer and for every incorrect answer takes away 10 seconds from the timer.
The quiz will run until you the time reaches 0, regardless of if it begins to repeat itself.
After completing the quiz, it will tell you your score and ask you to put in your name for the highscore board. If you set the highscore, it will save your name and score to local storage.

In the assets folder are screenshots of each page.
